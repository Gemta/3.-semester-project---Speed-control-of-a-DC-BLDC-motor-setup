# 3. semester project - Speed control of a DC/BLDC motor setup
The code made for the 3. semester project of the Electronics Engineering course at SDU. The project was to use a Buck-converter and a PID-controller to control the speed of a DC motor coupled with BLDC motor connected to a variable resistor.
